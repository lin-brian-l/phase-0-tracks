Release 0
- Google "jquery" and search for sites providing examples of what it is and how it's used
- Find and do practice problems with jquery; maybe use exercism?
- Take a 5 min break every 25 min to avoid burnout, but go harder if necessary

Release 1
- Strategies to find practice problems for jquery proved ineffective; I ended up attempting to perform various formating tasks (hide images, change borders, etc.) on my 2.5 Website.
- Googling for examples and solutions for problems worked well, but determining the proper terminology for my problem was difficult.
