		<u><h1>Introduction</h1></u>
		<p>Welcome! This website will provide basic tutorials on stoichiometric conversions. First, however, we'll need to talk about why any mathematical conversion (aka dimensional analysis) works.</p>

		<section>
			<u><h2>All are One</h2></u>
			<p>Conversions are based on <strong>equivalence statements</strong> - statements which claim two or more things are equal to each other. For example, let's take this claim everyone in the US should be familiar with:</p>

			<p>From grade school, we've been taught that there are 12 inches in 1 foot. But let's try something - let's divide both sides by 1 foot.</p>
			<img src="index-images/2.png" alt="Step 2" class="hover">
			<p>On the right-hand side of the equation, note that we now have 1 foot divided by 1 foot; any time a fraction has the same numerator and denominator, it's equal to 1!</p>
			<img src="index-images/3.png" alt="Step 3" class="hover">
			<p>Thus, "12 inches / 1 foot" is equal to 1. We'll get back to this later - for now, let's go back to our starting point.</p>
			<img src="index-images/1.png" alt="Step 1" class="hover">
			<p>Instead of dividing both sides by 1 foot, let's divide by 1 inch instead. This gives us the following:</p>
			<img src="index-images/4.png" alt="Step 4" class="hover">
			<p>Like above, we now have a fraction where the numerator and denominator are the same. This now turns into:</p>
			<img src="index-images/5.png" alt="Step 5" class="hover">
			<p>So now, 1 is equal to "1 foot divided by 12 inches". <em>Buuuuuuuuuuuuuut...</em> keep in mind that we said "12 inches / 1 foot" is equal to 1". This lets us say the following:</p>
			<img src="index-images/6.png" alt="Step 6" class="hover">			
			<img src="index-images/7.png" alt="Step 7" class="hover">
			<p>This may not hold any significance to you now, but we'll go through some practice problems illustrating why this is so important. To get a stronger grasp on how to apply conversion factors, try out the next section, <a href="conversions.html">Conversion Factors</a>. Otherwise, feel free to move on to the next lesson, <a href="mole.html">The Mole</a>.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/chemistry/stoichiometry/stoichiometriccalculations/section1.rhtml">Sparknotes</a> has a great website on how to perform conversion factors. It's formatting is pretty clear and, although it doesn't get into the mechanics of why conversion factors work, it gives a bunch of examples about how to use them. Additionally, it gets into more complicated stiochiometric conversions which we will not discuss (at this time!).</p>
