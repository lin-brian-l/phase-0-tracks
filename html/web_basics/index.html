	<h1>How Smash Bros. Changed 2D Fighters</h1>
	<p><em>Super Smash Bros.</em> is a game series featuring a cast (primarily) composed of Nintendo characters. Although its creator, Masahiro Sakurai, may not have intended it, Smash inspired an entirely new genre of 2D fighting games - the platform fighter. For the purpose of this explanation, I will be referencing the mechanics of the original <em>Super Smash Bros.</em>, which was released on the Nintendo 64 in 1999.

	<h2>Superficial Differences from 2D Fighters</h2>

	<p>Pictured above is a screenshot from Street Fighter V, a series which is widely regarded to be the forefront of 2D fighters. Although the heads-up display (HUD) and stages vary from different games, onlookers are treated to two main features:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>depleting life bars for either character and</li>
		<li>a flat plane where combat takes place.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>In comparison, here's a screenshot of the original <em>Super Smash Bros</em> (SSB64).</p>

	<p>In stark contrast to the screenshot from <em>Street Fighter V</em> (SFV), the two largest differences (other than the disparity in graphics and number of characters on the screen) are that there are <em>no life bars</em> and <em>combat takes place on multiple platforms</em> (as seen by characters standing on different sections of the screen). To the casual viewer, these two differences may hold no significance whatsoever. However, to anyone who has played both games, these two simple differences have created <strong>entirely different</strong> sets of mechanics for both games.</p>

	<h2>Mechanical Differences from 2D Fighters</h2>
	<p>As a precursory look at the sheer number of differences between SSB64 and SFV, here's a list of just a few items:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Ground Movement - SFV restricts players to moving left and right while always facing the opponent, but SSB64 offers unrestricted movement and allows players to move anywhere along the stage.</li>
		<li>Air Movement - SFV allows players to jump once, but characters are not airborne for long periods of time. SSB64 gives players <strong>two jumps</strong>, not only stressing the importance of aerial combat but also allowing for players to change when they land back to the ground.</li>
		<li>Platforms - All combat in SFV is exclusively on a single plane, but combat in SSB64 takes place across multiple platforms. This allows for many more possible angles of attack and ways to defend against the opponent.</li>
		<li>Controls - SFV has movesets which vary for each character depending on <em>sequences</em> of button presses, but Smash uses a universal moveset which revolves around combining <em>direction</em> of the joystick with button presses.</li>
		<li>Defense - SFV's primary defensive mechanic is blocking, in which the defender must choose to block high or low attacks, whereas SSB64's primary defensive mechanic is the shield, which is a "bubble" that covers the defender and shrinks over time.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>This is just a precursory glance over the differences between the two games - as you may guess, there are many more factors which lead to drastically different gameplay. SSB64 gave birth to many other platform fighters, including its successor, <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em>.
