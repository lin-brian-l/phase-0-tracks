# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	Version control is the ability to control edits to a file, which can be done on an individual basis or by multiple people working simultaneously. This way, changes can be made by more than one person without changing the master file and said changes can be approved by multiple people before those changes can be merged.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	Branches are copies of a master directory, which allow people to make changes without worrying about changing the master file. Once changes are finalized and checked, branches can be merged with the master directory, thereby updating it.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	A commit is when changes made to any branch (master or otherwise) are finalized and incorporated. Such incorporations appear in a log in the .git folder. A good commit message includes (1) the name of the user, (2) the date of their commit, and (3) what they committed.
* What is a merge conflict?
	A merge conflict is when multiple commits make changes to the same line and/or contradict each other, in which case Git's automated process cannot determine which commit is correct.
