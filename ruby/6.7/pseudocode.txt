Game Pseudocode

1. Create class for "GuessingGame"
2. Initialize variables for word (user1_input), guess (user2_input), and array of guesses (history) = []
3. Create method to set # of guesses proportional to word length of user1_input.
4. Create method to compare user2_input with user1_input.
	a) Print blank spaces = user1_input.length
	b) Store user2_input into history array.
	c) If user2_input is not in user1_input, print "Guess again!" and subtract # of guesses by 1 and add 1 to # of tries.
	d) If user2_input is in history array, then print "You've guessed that already!" and # of guesses is unaffected.
	e) If user2_input is in user1_input, then print that letter instead of a blank space. Print remaining # of guesses and # of tries taken.
	f) Exit comparison method when all of user1_input letters are printed.
5. Create reader for history array and setter for user2_input.
