### Release 1: Fibonacci Numbers
pseudocode
create a method that takes the number of Fibonacci Numbers that the user wants
if that number is 1, pass an array [0]
if that number is 2, pass the array [0,1]
if the number is 3 or greater
  continue to add numbers to the array until the length is == the argument passed to the method
  to add a term to array: take the last two numbers of the FIB array (indexing with -1, -2)
  add those numbers together
  push to FIB array
  send FIB array back when length is equal to the length requested
=end
